### Expertise

I have a broad experience in several fields of _Biology_
and good knowledge in statistics and informatics.
This makes me an intermediate asset to link subject-matter experts with
developers of new analytic solutions in life sciences.

My main expertise revolves around the R software and a stack of
technologies applicable in the domains of:
observational studies, real-world evidence, genetics, biomarkers,
clinical trials for those connected with medical research.
These domains are completed by agro-geostatistics, plant physiology and
crop sciences which constituted my initial field of interest and development.

### Education and Experience

Since my Master of applied statistics, followed by a Dual Ph.D. degree in
crop sciences and several experiences, including in medical sciences,
I have tested, validated and deployed my methods:

- With middle size private institutes, universities, an hospital, a
  start-up, a major pharmaceutical company.
- For public research first in crop sciences (wheat crops) and then
  in medical research
  (genetics, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes);
   work published in peer-reviewed journals
  (<a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0524-5755" target="_blank">ORCID</a>).
- For products in pharma, 
  and genetics-guided personalised medicine (Imagene.me),
  geospatial modelling (Farmstar).
- During long-term on-site assignments in three countries: France, UK, Poland.
- Fully remotely from Poland with Swiss and Belgium clients as part of
  international teams (from Japan to California).
