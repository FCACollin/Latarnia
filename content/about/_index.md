I am a statistical consultant and programmer. 

# What I can do:

Observational studies, Real world data, Study design,
Statistical Analysis Plans (SAPs), genetics (NGS) and biomarker
identification, Clinical algorithms (cutting-edge Machine Learning),
Support for publication, Automated reporting and much more.

As a statistical consultant I propose to :
execute datamining strategies, provided advises or 
training.
Since my Master of applied statistics, followed by a Dual Ph.D. degree in biology
and several experiences, including in medical sciences, I have tested, validated and deployed my methods:

- With private institutes, universities, an hospital and a start-up.
- For public research first in crop sciences (wheat crops) and more
recently in medical research
(genetics, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes);
 work published in peer-reviewed journals
(<a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0524-5755" target="_blank"
 >ORCID</a>).
- For private products in geospatial modelling (Farmstar)
  and development of personalised medicine products (Imagene.me).
- During long-term assignments in three countries:
  France, UK, Poland.
- And presented my work within companies, taught techniques to
  students, summed up to private stakeholders, or promoted results
  during international conferences.

I look for the best methods for
specific purposes, therefore I have been
using a large range of statistical techniques:
from simple inferential techniques (Anova, linear regressions, mixed models)
to more advanced predictive/machine-learning/
algorithms, survival analysis, exploration factorial plans, analysis of surveys and sensory data, text analysis, experimental design. CODE AND SOFTWARE: R, Python, SQL and much more.

My role is to transform collections of data into information that will empower decisions.  By digging into the underlying associations and patterns found in a corpus of data, an information can be extracted. This information is concretely a better knowledge of your field (e.g. drug efficiency, client segregation, machine performances), and/or valuable to anticipate your next move thanks to predictive modelling (e.g. survival studies, market demand/supply in the next quarter).
