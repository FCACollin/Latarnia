The sensitivity and the specificity evaluate the performances
of the clinical decision support; for a given decision rule, the former
indicates the proportion of real-positive case detected, the
latter reports the proportion of false alarms. The Area Under 
the Curves accounts for general evaluation of the algorithm,
while testing the whole range of decision rules.
The tumour genetics is strongly discriminating tumour
histological subtypes.
