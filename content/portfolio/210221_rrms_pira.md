## Abstract

The aim of the study was to verify the association of clinical relapses and
brain activity with disability progression in relapsing/remitting multiple
sclerosis patients receiving disease-modifying treatments in Poland. Disability
progression was defined as relapse-associated worsening (RAW), progression
independent of relapse activity (PIRA), and progression independent of relapses
and brain MRI Activity (PIRMA). Data from the Therapeutic Program Monitoring
System were analyzed. Three panels of patients were identified: R0, no relapse
during treatment, and R1 and R2 with the occurrence of relapse during the first
and the second year of treatment, respectively. In the R0 panel, we detected
4.6% PIRA patients at 24 months (p &lt; 0.001, 5.0% at 36 months, 5.6% at 48
months, 6.1% at 60 months). When restricting this panel to patients without
brain MRI activity, we detected 3.0% PIRMA patients at 12 months, 4.5% at 24
months, and varying from 5.3% to 6.2% between 36 and 60 months of treatment,
respectively. In the R1 panel, RAW was detected in 15.6% patients at 12 months
and, in the absence of further relapses, 9.7% at 24 months and 6.8% at 36 months
of treatment. The R2 group was associated with RAW significantly more frequently
at 24 months compared to the R1 at 12 months (20.7%; p &lt; 0.05), but without a
statistical difference later on. In our work, we confirmed that disability
progression was independent of relapses and brain MRI activity.
