### Abstract

Introduction: RNA-seq has become a standard method for
transcriptome profiling of cancer tissues. A great number of
studies investigated genetic expression in order to identify
marker genes that could be used for diagnostic and/or
prognostic purposes. However, the generalisation of expression
pattern with limited number of genes may be inaccurate.
Instead of using a specific subset of genes, we propose to use
the whole RNA-seq profile to improve the diagnosis and
classification of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) through a
user-friendly platform.

Materials and Methods: A machine-learning algorithm
(Random Forest) which learns from RNA-seq profiles of NSCLC tissues,
collected in 123 patients (tumour and non-tumour samples) was
applied in order to discriminate histological subtypes of
NSCLC. The method has been implemented within the R
environment and the web platform has been built with the Shiny
package.

Results: The web platform actually allows the user, first, to
provide its own RNA-seq library; then it automatically fits a
Random Forest model based on the expressed genes; finally, it
returns a diagnosis along with its false discovery rate. The
prototype was assessed and cross validated. The best results
were obtained when full RNA-seq profiles were provided.

Conclusions: We propose our method as a universal approach of
use of whole RNA-seq data for diagnostic purposes in a simple
and straightforward manner.

The study was funded by the Polish National Centre for
Research and Development, the MOBIT project
(STRATEGMED2/266484/2/NCBR/2015).
