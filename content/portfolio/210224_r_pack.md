## What is this topic?

When starting an analysis with R, it is somewhat difficult to order your
files in a robust way. You probably wondered already, where should I save
this dataset? What to do with this script which is convenient but which
commented? How should I deliver the result of the analysis. This is what will
be addressed in this page, I hope soon.
