When working for Roche, beyond my (very) minor contribution to the topic,
interesting outcomes came around the MMRM. It was presented by
[Daniel Sabanés Bové](
https://ch.linkedin.com/in/danielsabanesbove?trk=author_mini-profile_title
) during _R/Pharma 2020_ conference,

Beyond the [slide deck](https://github.com/rinpharma/2020_presentations/blob/main/talks_folder/2020-Sabanes_Bove-Implementing_MMRM_in_R.pdf),
it evidences the active development in R to answer pharma challenges.
