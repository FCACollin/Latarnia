This is the result of a familiarisation task to use R with Application
Programming Interfaces (API) queries and geospatial libraries.

It aims at using
publicly available data to estimate the air concentration in particulate
matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter (PM10) in any place in Poland.  

Air quality data were downloaded via an API query at
[powietrze.gios.gov.pl](https://powietrze.gios.gov.pl/pjp/content/api)
while the geographical shape data were downloaded via an API query at 
[gisco-services.ec.europa.eu](
https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/nuts/nuts-2016-files.html
). The complete procedure is explained at <https://fcacollin.github.io/Geo/>.

The results include an interactive map based on `leaflet` added on
an OpenStreetMap layer.

As the data were available at hourly interval, some attempts where made to
generate a 24 hour animated image.
