Multiple Correspondence Analysis with R, or 
how to dig into qualitative variable associations?
<!--more-->

When working with factor variables, it is of interest to understand
the preferential association between different factor levels: was the
patient blood type preferentially associated with disease-free status? 
A frequent strategy would rely on Chi-2 test to verify if the
modalities of two factors are independently distributed.
The Multiple Correspondence Analysis can be seen as a generalisation where
the Chi-2 square corresponds to a distance in a resulting factorial map.


The example below relied on the package
[`FactoMineR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html)
to compute the
Multiple Correspondence Analysis factorial map, result visualization was
enhanced with
[`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
to represent patients, factor levels as well as
an illustrative variable (factors projected in the map which did not contribute
to its definition).
