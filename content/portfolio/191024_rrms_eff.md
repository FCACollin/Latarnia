## Abstract

**Objective**

The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of
disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in relapsing-remitting
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients treated in MS centres in
Poland.

**Material and methods**

Demographic and clinical data of all Polish RRMS patients
receiving DMTs were prospectively collected from 2014 to 2018
in electronic files using the Therapeutic Program Monitoring
System (SMPT).

**Results**

The study included 10,764 RRMS patients treated with DMTs in
first-line and 1,042 in second-line programmes.
IFNβ more effectively lengthened the times to the
first relapse, disability progression, and brain MRI activity than GA.
After 2 and 4 years of follow-up, more patients on IFNβ showed
no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) in comparison to GA
(66.3% and 44.3% vs 55.2% and 33.2%, respectively;
 p &lt; 0.001). NAT more effectively reduced brain MRI activity
than FTY (p = 0.001). More patients under NAT had NEDA-3 after
2 and 4 years of follow-up compared to FTY
(66.2% and 42.1% vs 52.1% and 29.5%, respectively; p = 0.03). In adjusted
analysis, a higher baseline Expanded Disability Status Score
(EDSS) was a predictor of relapse (p&lt;0.001) and NEDA-3
failure (p = 0.003).

**Conclusions**

IFNβ compared to GA and NAT compared to FTY more effectively
reduced disease activity in a Polish population of RRMS
patients.
