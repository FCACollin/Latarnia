## Abstract

**Aim of study**

The aim of this study was to collect and analyse data on
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients
receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in Poland.

**Material and methods**

This observational, multicentre study with prospective data
collection included RRMS patients receiving DMTs reimbursed by
the National Health Fund (NFZ) in Poland, monitored by the
Therapeutic Programme Monitoring System (SMPT). Demographic
profiles, disability status, and treatment modalities were
analysed.

**Results**

Data from 11,632 RRMS patients was collected
(from 15,368 new prescriptions), including 10,649 patients in
the first-line and 983 in the second-line therapeutic
programme of DMTs. The proportion of females to males was
2.39 in the first-line and 1.91 in the second-line. The mean
age at DMTs start was 36.6 years in the first-line and 35.1 in
the second-line. The median time from the first symptoms to MS
diagnosis was 7.4 months, and from MS diagnosis to treatment
it was 18.48 months. A total of 43.4% of MS patients started
DMT during the 12 months following diagnosis. There was a
positive correlation between the duration from MS diagnosis to
the start of DMT and a higher initial EDSS value
[correlation 0.296 (p &lt; 0.001)]. About 10% of patients
stopped DMTs. In Poland, about one third of all MS patients
are treated in both lines, and the choice of first-line
treatment depends on the region of the country.

**Conclusions**

In Poland there is a need to increase MS patient access to
DMTs by improving the organisation of drug programmes.
