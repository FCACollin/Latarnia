Forest plots are a clever way to combine tables and graphs. They are of
interest for comparison, for instance to understand what factor has the
largest effect size on a risk. Candidate solutions exist in R. However,
in my humble opinion, none of them offers yet a well designed user interface
doing the job and allowing flexibility. Current solutions are too specific to
the domain they were coded for. Still, I am confident that the gap will soon
be filled given the dynamic community out there!
