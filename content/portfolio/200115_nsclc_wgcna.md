## Abstract

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous group of
malignancies consisting essentially of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC). Although the diagnosis and treatment of ADC and SCC have been
greatly improved in recent decades, there is still an urgent need to identify
accurate transcriptome profile associated with the histological subtypes of
NSCLC. The present study aims to identify the key dysregulated pathways and
genes involved in the development of lung ADC and SCC and to relate them with
the clinical traits. The transcriptional changes between tumour and normal
lung tissues were investigated by RNA-seq. Gene ontology (GO), canonical
pathways analysis with the prediction of upstream regulators, and weighted
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify co-expressed modules
and hub genes were used to explore the biological functions of the identified
dysregulated genes. It was indicated that specific gene signatures differed
significantly between ADC and SCC related to the distinct pathways. Of
identified modules, four and two modules were the most related to clinical
features in ADC and SCC, respectively. CTLA4, MZB1, NIP7, and BUB1B in ADC, as
well as GNG11 and CCNB2 in SCC, are novel top hub genes in modules associated
with tumour size, SUVmax, and recurrence-free survival. Our research provides
a more effective understanding of the importance of biological pathways and
the relationships between major genes in NSCLC in the perspective of searching
for new molecular targets.
