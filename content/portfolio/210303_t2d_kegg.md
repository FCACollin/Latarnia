Connect the Differential Expression of RNA-Seq data with KEGG pathway
representations. The [Shiny App](https://latarnia.shinyapps.io/kegg_demo/).

<!--more-->

Comparing two study arms in terms of genetic expression profile (e.g. RNA-Seq),
result in the _Differential Expression_ estimates for each gene.
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
([KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)) provides a high-level reading of
genes and pathways, it is possible to overlay directly the
differential expression estimates over a KEGG pathway.
The [Shiny App](https://latarnia.shinyapps.io/kegg_demo/) is an
example of possible visualization.
