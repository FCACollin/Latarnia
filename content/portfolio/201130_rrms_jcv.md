## Abstract

**Introduction**

Presence of anti-JC-virus antibodies (JCVAb) is associated
with increased risk of natalizumab-related progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Less it is known about
seroconversion rate and time to seroconversion in
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients treated
with natalizumab (NAT) in Poland. The aim of the study was to
assess the true risk of PML, seroconversion rate and time to
seroconversion  in all JCVAb negative RRMS patients treated
with NAT in Poland.

**Methods**

Demographic and clinical data of all Polish RRMS patients
treated with NAT reimbursed by National Health Fund (NFZ) were
prospectively collected in electronic files using the
Therapeutic Program Monitoring System (SMPT) provided by NFZ.
The assessment of JCVAb presence
(without collection of JCVAb index value) in serum
(Unilabs, STRATIFY JCV: anti-JCV antibody ELISA)
was done at the beginning of therapy and then
repeated every 6 months. The maximum  follow-up time was 4
years. In Poland, since 2013, according to the NFZ drug
programme guidance only patients with negative JCVAb test have
started treatment with NAT.

**Results**

In all Polish MS centres 210 negative JCVAb RRMS patients with
at least 9 (±3) months of observation
(146 females, 64 males; the median age at baseline: 33 years)
were included in the study. During follow-up period JCVAb status changed from
negative to positive in 34 patients (16.2%). For half of the
patients the seroconversion was diagnosed 1 year after
starting NAT treatment. In 4 patients (1.9%) during follow-up
JCVAb status changed again from positive to negative. In
Poland, before establishment of NFZ drug programme, 4 cases of
PML in patients treated with NAT in clinical trials were
diagnosed. In the NFZ drug programme, since 2013 no patient
treated with NAT has been diagnosed with PML.

**Conclusions**

Natalizumab therapy in JCV seronegative RRMS patients is safe
and results in absence of PML cases. In Poland, JCV
seroconversion rate is similar to observed in other European
countries.
