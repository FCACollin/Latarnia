Interactivity with Plotly, an example with Empirical Cumulative Distribution
Function.

<!--more-->

An interactive version of a graphic is:

- impactful: the audience is watching.
- efficient: a single interactive plot replace several versions of a graph at
  different timepoints.

The graphic below was prepared with [_plotly_](https://plotly.com/r/).
The traceability and reproducibility of the graphs is a regular
good practice challenge, in the present case, I suggest an information
box on hovering _GxP Info_.
