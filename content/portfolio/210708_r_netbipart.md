Among networks, I found the bipartite networks especially informative.
They help revealing inter-class links instead of focusing
in intra-class associations. For instance, that is especially relevant when
studying expression of micro RNA and mRNA.

In the example below:

- colours and shapes refer to feature classes
- and line types refer to associations depending on experimental conditions.
