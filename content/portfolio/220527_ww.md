It is not like visualisation is my favourite topic, but that is part of the
job.
The figure below is a submission to a monthly PSI Visualisation challenge.
The final version can be found in the Wonderful Wednesdays seminar
[page](https://vis-sig.github.io/blog/posts/2022-04-30-wonderful-wednesdays-april-2022/#example-2.-barcharts)
of April 2022.
The data proposed for the challenge:

> "_reflects a phase III study - active vs placebo and the endpoint
> was Ordinal Scale for Improvement (OSCI). All patients started at OSCI=4
> and daily measures over 35 days were performed. The challenge was to describe
> the treatment effect specifically taking into account the number and timing
> of patients who died, left the hospital or fully recovered_"
> (shamlessly copy-pasted from the original
[page](https://vis-sig.github.io/blog/posts/2022-04-30-wonderful-wednesdays-april-2022))

My proposition uses bars which extend below and above the 0 axis line
which differentiates improvement from the absence of improvement.
To provide more detailed information, shades accounts for the intensity of the
response. Since approximately 4.5% of the world population is colour-blind,
accessibility is also accounted for by using two colour-blind-friendly palette
extending each side of the 0 line.
