## Abstract

The Septoria tritici blotch disease (STB, pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici) is the
most damaging foliar infection of wheat crops in Europe. Disease management
strategies include cultivar resistance, disease escape strategy and fungicides.
However, these strategies have failed to provide a complete protection of wheat
crops. The STB tolerance is a complementary approach which aims to maintain
yield in the presence of the symptoms. The tolerance of STB relies on plant
physiology and source/sink balance: the sink demand (the grain growth) must be
satisfied in spite of reduced source availability (photosynthetic capacity as
affected by the STB symptoms on the leaves).

## Extracts

### Wheat Growth as Functions

<p>The grain yield and senescence observations were fit against
logistic and Gompertz function, respectively; the estimates
(lines) and observations (points) can be represented in joint graphic

### Predict Scenescence Timing with Random Forest

<p>The scenescence was predicted by a rather large number of predictors,
the model was then use to classify candidate predictors of interest.
